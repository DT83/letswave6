{"name":"Letswave 6","tagline":"Letswave 6 - Matlab EEG signal processing toolbox ","body":"### Welcome to Letswave.\r\n\r\nLetswave is a free software toolbox to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) and other neurophysiological signals. This new version has been rewritten entirely, taking into consideration structural limitations of Letswave 5.  As compared to existing signal processing toolboxes, emphasis is placed on intuitive and streamlined tools to process and visualize EEG data, with a shallow learning curve. The new version provides advanced scripting possibilities. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project is managed by André Mouraux (Institute of Neuroscience, Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium), in collaboration with Bruno Rossion (Institute of Neuroscience, Université catholique de Louvain), Li Hu (Southwest University, China) and Giandomenico Iannetti (University College London, UK).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
